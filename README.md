# CMPM121-Final
# Devlog Entry - [11/20]

## Introducing the team

Tools Lead: Zhuo Chen

Engine Lead: Lizhuoyuan Wan

Design Lead: Zexuan Li

Coding Lead: Xing Zhong



## Tools and materials
**Tell us about what engines, libraries, frameworks, and or platforms you intend to use, and give us a tiny bit of detail about why your team chose those.**

We plan to use Unity for our game, and the engines we use include, but are not limited to, the Unity engine. The reason why we choose unity as our game engine is that we are learning to use the unity engine, so we need to use it more to verify the knowledge we have learned about unity. We believe that after the end of this project, our proficiency in using unity will be further improved.



**Tell us programming languages (e.g. TypeScript) and data languages (e.g. JSON) you team expects to use and why you chose them. Presumably youâ€™ll just be using the languages expected by your previously chosen engine/platform.**

Because of we use unity engine, based on this choice, our programming language will be C# language. Our data language will be JSON, because unity has mature support for the JSON data format.



**Tell us about which tools you expect to use in the process of authoring your project. You might name the IDE for writing code, the image editor for creating visual assets, or the 3D editor you will use for building your scene. Again, briefly tell us why you made these choices. Maybe one of your teammates feels especially skilled in that tool or it represents something you all want to learn about.**

We will develop our game using tools such as Unity Hub and VS Code, and the Unity engine will be version 2022.3.10f. The reason we choose unity is that unity has a mature development process and rich support. Once we encounter a problem, we can quickly find a solution.



## Outlook
**What do you anticipate being the hardest or riskiest part of the project?**

We anticipate that the most difficult part of the project will be building our game scene entirely through code, and the functionality of undo and redo.



**What are you hoping to learn by approaching the project with the tools and materials you selected above?**

We hope to use this project to practice the various design patterns we learned in class, become more familiar with the use of the unity engine, and improve our team collaboration capabilities.
